**`CS 144: Computer Networking`**
## Homegrown Networking Stack â€“ A Comprehensive Overview

This project is focused on the implementation of a TCP receiver, sender, and the overall connections object, it allows for reliable bidirectional data transmission with existing versions of TCP.

### TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
TCP forms one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It operates at the transport layer and provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes. It ensures that data packets are reassembled in the order in which they were sent and handles lost or duplicated packets.

### Key Components

- **`TCP Receiver`:** Responsible for receiving data segments, it ensures proper ordering and handles duplicate segments. Plays a vital role in the acknowledgment mechanism.

- **`TCP Sender`:** Manages the transmission of data segments, including handling retransmissions in case of lost packets. It uses algorithms like sliding window to control the flow of data.

- **`Connections Object`:** Acts as a bridge between the receiver and sender, tying them together to ensure smooth, reliable communication. It coordinates the various aspects of TCP, such as connection establishment and termination.

### Features of the Networking Stack

* **Reliable Data Transmission:** Ensures that the data is transferred accurately and in order, handling any network inconsistencies.
* **Bidirectional Communication:** Allows for two-way communication between the sender and receiver, using the established TCP connection.
* **Integration with Existing TCP Versions:** Compatible with existing versions of TCP, allowing for interoperability with other TCP implementations.
